# Space Shooter
 Simple Galaga Clone
# Inspiration
A friend of mine made some cool sprites in order to make a their own version of galaga and approached me about helping them with development. I ended up creating simple level, learning how to use Unity's physics engine, along with C# scripts to keep track of motion and data like lives. I was then able to teach them some of the basics of unity so they could develop more on their own.
